    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water 
            in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making 
            crust. Freeze remaining paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, 
            sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended 
            (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, 
            until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until 
            dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) 
            into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
        </li>
        <li>
            For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, 
            pepperoni and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is 
            bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom 
            oven racks halfway through baking.
        </li>
