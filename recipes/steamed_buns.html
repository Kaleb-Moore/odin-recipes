    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These Pork buns are something that is both so easy to make and so delicious.
        They are good with noodles or dinner of any kind and are excellent on their own as a meal.
        I often make these as a meal to bring to work the next day, and after a quick 30 
        seconds in the microwave they are just as delicious as before.

        <li>1/4 Cup Finely Sliced Green Onions</li>
        <li>1 Pinch Cayenne Pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Pour water into a bowl. Sprinkle in yeast and let stand until yeast softens 
                and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes. Add vegetable oil, sugar, and 
                self-rising flour. Mix using a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough comes together.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Turn dough out onto your counter and knead into a smooth ball, about 10 minutes.
                 Transfer dough ball into a lightly oiled bowl. Flip to lightly coat. Cover 
                 and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combine pork, green onions, cayenne pepper, sesame oil, and hoisin sauce in 
                a separate bowl. Mix well and refrigerate.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add a couple inches of water to a Dutch oven and set a bamboo steamer on top.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Poke dough down to deflate and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Cut 
                dough in half and roll each half into a long tube. Divide each tube into 6 
                pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and press into a disk. Roll each disk 
                until about 1/8-inch thick and 4 to 5 inches wide. Roll out edges so they are 
                slightly thinner than the center.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Transfer a spoonful of filling onto the center of each dough circle. Pinch 
                edges together to form multiple small pleats, moistening edges with water if 
                needed. Squeeze pleats together at the top to seal in the filling. Place pork 
                buns on individual squares of parchment paper. Transfer them to the cold 
                steamer, cover, and let proof until noticeably puffed, 30 to 45 minutes.

                Bring the water in the Dutch oven to a boil over high heat. Set timer for 
                10 minutes. Turn off heat and leave buns covered for 15 minutes. Uncover 
                and transfer to plate.
